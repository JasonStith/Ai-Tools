The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive AI filmmaking platform, starting from initial product requirements to a production-ready application with a demo mode. The development was highly iterative and user-driven, focusing on cloning the UI/UX of leading creative platforms like Adobe Firefly, Suno.ai, ChatGPT, Midjourney, Hedra, and LTX Studio for specific modules. A full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) was established, and Replicate integration for AI models was implemented, along with robust error handling. Critical attention was paid to GitHub safety by meticulously removing API keys and setting up environment variable placeholders. The AI engineer was mid-development on the Brainstorm Ideas module, cloning Milanote's interface, when the task was passed. The process demonstrated strong adherence to user requests, technical problem-solving, and continuous UI refinement.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an AI filmmaking website cloning Adobe Firefly's layout, featuring a pipeline of 14 AI tools integrated with Replicate. The goal was to simplify the filmmaking process from 0 to 1, covering Torch Builder, Script Writer, Character Builder, Environment Builder, Story Board Builder, Animation, Voices, Lip Sync, Music, SFX, Titles, VFX, Editing, Product, and Distribution. Over the course of development, specific requests emerged to clone interfaces of other popular applications for dedicated modules: Suno.ai for the Music Studio, ChatGPT for the Script Writer, Midjourney for the Gallery, Hedra for the Character Builder, LTX Studio for the Storyboard Builder, and Milanote for the Brainstorm Ideas module. The user also emphasized GitHub safety by requiring the removal of sensitive API keys and implementing a demo mode.

<code_architecture>


*   : This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for various AI tools, handles Replicate API calls, and includes logic for using dummy data when actual API keys are not provided. It also maintains the dynamic list and order of AI tools presented to the frontend.
*   : Stores environment-specific variables like , , , and . It was initially populated with a real Replicate token, then emptied and set to placeholder values for GitHub safety.
*   : Created to serve as a guide for users on required environment variables without exposing sensitive information.
*   : The main React component, responsible for global layout, routing between different sections (homepage, individual tool modules), and integrating the various components. It was modified extensively to implement the Adobe Firefly-inspired design, dynamic hero text, and conditional rendering of specialized tool UIs.
*   : Manages the top navigation bar. It was refined to match Adobe Firefly's minimalist design, removing icons and implementing a subtle white underline for the active navigation tab, and displaying a demo mode banner.
*   : Defines the prominent hero section on the homepage. It was redesigned with a purple-pink gradient background, a search bar, and its central text was iterated from Explore new ways to create to Imagine. and finally to Imagine. Your story. with gradient styling.
*   : Displays the grid of all available AI tools. Its design was updated to align with the overall dark theme and professional card layout, including category filtering and hover effects.
*   : Acts as a router and container for individual tool modules. It redirects to specific React components (e.g., , ) based on the selected tool, ensuring a modular and extensible architecture.
*   : A new component meticulously cloned from Suno.ai's interface, providing a detailed music creation workspace with lyrics input, style tags, and song management.
*   : A new component that replicates ChatGPT's clean, conversational interface, optimized for screenplay writing with message bubbles and formatting.
*   : A new component mirroring Midjourney's gallery, featuring a masonry grid layout, content filtering, and professional image display.
*   : A new component cloning Hedra's sleek interface for character creation, including detailed controls for attributes, style, and reference image uploads.
*   : A new component that recreates LTX Studio's dashboard and a preliminary editor interface for storyboarding, complete with tool cards and project management.
*   : A newly created component, currently under development, intended to clone Milanote's canvas-based brainstorming interface.
*   , , : These files collectively manage the styling and design system. They were extensively modified to implement the dark theme, custom gradients, typography, and responsive design across the entire application to match the desired aesthetics.
*   : Created to explicitly ignore sensitive files (like ) and build artifacts from version control.
*   : Updated to provide a comprehensive setup guide, especially detailing environment variable requirements and how to run the application in demo mode.
*   : A new file defining the project's licensing terms.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation and functionality of the Brainstorm Ideas module, cloning Milanote's canvas interface.
-   Integrate the backend logic for the Brainstorm Ideas module, including handling generated ideas and canvas elements.
-   Further develop dedicated interfaces for other AI tools in the pipeline (e.g., Environment Builder, Animation, Voices).

<current_work>
The immediate work before this summary request was focused on initiating the Brainstorm Ideas module. The user explicitly requested this module to be designed as a clone of Milanote's canvas-based brainstorming interface.

Specifically, the following actions were taken:
1.  **Creation of **: A new React component file was successfully created at . This file is the foundation for building out the Milanote-inspired UI and its interactive canvas elements.
2.  **Redirection Setup in **: The  component, which acts as the central hub for navigating to individual AI tool modules, was updated. This ensures that when a user selects the Brainstorm Ideas tool from the main gallery, they are correctly redirected to the new  component.

In preparation for this module and as per previous user requests, the backend's tool list in  was already updated to include Brainstorm Ideas as the very first tool. The tool list was also reordered to place Torch Builder before Distribution, making Distribution the final tool in the overall pipeline. The frontend UI reflects this updated tool order.

The current state is that the necessary frontend component file for Brainstorm Ideas exists, and the application's routing correctly directs users to it. The actual UI and interactive canvas functionality within  are still to be implemented to fully realize the Milanote clone as requested.
